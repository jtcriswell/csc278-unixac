 * Function: getdirname()
 *
 * Description:
 * 	Given an absolute pathname with three top-level directories (the first
 * 	being the root directory), create a new pathname that includes only
 * 	the first set of pathname components.
 *
 * Inputs:
 * 	pathname   - A pointer to a string containing the pathname.  The
 * 	             pathname *must* be of the form /dir1/dir2/file.
 *
 * 	components - The number of components to include in the resulting
 * 	             pathname.
 *
 * Return Value:
 * 	Success - A pointer to the new pathname (which is allocated on the heap)
 * 	          is returned.
 * 	Error   - Otherwise, a NULL pointer is returned.

 * Inputs:
